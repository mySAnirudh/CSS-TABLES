This chapter teaches you how to set different properties of an HTML table using 
CSS. You can set the following properties of a table:
 The border-collapse specifies whether the browser should control the 
appearance of the adjacent borders that touch each other or whether each 
cell should maintain its style.
 The border-spacing specifies the width that should appear between table 
cells.
 The caption-side captions are presented in the <caption> element. By 
default, these are rendered above the table in the document. You use 
the caption-side property to control the placement of the table caption.
 The empty-cells specifies whether the border should be shown if a cell is 
empty.
 The table-layout allows browsers to speed up the layout of a table by 
using the first width properties it comes across for the rest of a column 
rather than having to load the whole table before rendering it.
Now, we will see how to use these properties with examples.
